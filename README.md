# vim-caddy-server-syntax

Vim support for [Caddy's](https://caddyserver.com/) [Caddyfile](https://caddyserver.com/docs/caddyfile).

Includes syntax, indentation, and comment support, without depending on a static list of directives.

## Installation

As a **normal user**:

```sh
mkdir -p ~/.vim/pack/user/start
cd ~/.vim/pack/user/start
git clone https://github.com/iacchus/vim-caddy-server-syntax
```

If you are running vim/neovim **with `sudo` and the syntax highlighting isn't appearing**, you'll need to install it **as `root` user** instead:

```sh
sudo su -
mkdir -p ~/.vim/pack/user/start
cd ~/.vim/pack/user/start
git clone https://github.com/iacchus/vim-caddy-server-syntax
```
